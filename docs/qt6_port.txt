Notes for the porting of SMILI to Qt6

Alot of the work was done by porting to Qt 5.15, so this is the first step.

QDesktopWidget was removed and required changing qApp->desktop() to the qscreen call qApp->primaryScreen()

Needed to replace QVTKWidget with newer QVTKOpenGLStereoWidget. This replaced the GetRenderWindow() with renderWindow() and thus needed small API changes throughout milxQt. 

A few header includes and stl usage had to be improved for newer cpp17 standard. Particularly for MOC generation, if a VTK header was missing, in our case vtkMatrix4x4, it caused a compile error in the vtkSmartPointer class.

Error QVTKOpenGLWindow requires a `vtkGenericOpenGLRenderWindow` was caused by unnecessary calls to set the vtkRenderWindow via SetRenderWindow()
